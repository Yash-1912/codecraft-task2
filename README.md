### Objective
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.

---

### Description
This task involves cleaning and analyzing the Titanic dataset using exploratory data analysis techniques. Missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and visualizations are created to identify survival patterns.

---

### Dataset
**Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)**

**Dataset Source:**  
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

---

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

### Methodology
- Loaded the Titanic training dataset  
- Checked dataset structure and missing values  
- Filled missing Age values using median  
- Filled missing Embarked values using mode  
- Dropped Cabin column  
- Converted categorical values to numeric  
- Performed exploratory data analysis  

---

### Visualizations Used
- Bar chart for survival count
- Bar chart for survival rate by gender
- Histogram for age distribution
- All visualizations were created using Matplotlib.

---

### Output
- Cleaned dataset  
- Multiple visualizations showing survival patterns  

---

### Conclusion
The analysis shows that females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates. Age and fare also influenced survival probability.
